1. Generate some test inputs and walk through them by hand (Identify potential edge cases)
1. Discuss the "naive" or "brute force" solution to the problem, if applicable
1. Problem solve (E.g. draw a picture, make an analogy, brainstorm a data structure/algorithm to use, compare/contrast with similar/different problems, list out relevant tools you have and pick the right one, break down the problem into smaller problems and solve those first)
1. Pick a solution (consider tradeoffs)
1. Psuedocode your solution
1. Code your solution
1. Walk through test inputs with your coded solution
